Abstract of the paper: 
Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC), which can simultaneously perform both radar and communication functionalities using the same hardware platform, spectral resource and transmit waveform, is a promising technique for realizing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) in multi-antenna radar systems is the primary tool for detecting moving targets in the presence of strong clutter. The idea of joint spatial-temporal optimization in STAP-based radar systems is consistent with the concept of symbol-level precoding (SLP) for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications, which optimizes the transmit waveform for each of the transmitted symbols. In this paper, we combine STAP and SLP and propose a novel STAP-SLP-based DFRC system that enjoys the advantages of both techniques. The radar output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit waveform and receive filter, while satisfying the communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraint and various waveform constraints including constant-modulus, similarity and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). An efficient algorithm framework based on majorization-minimization (MM) and nonlinear equality constrained alternative direction method of multipliers (neADMM) methods is proposed to solve these complicated non-convex optimization problems. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed STAP-SLP-based MIMO-DRFC scheme and the associate algorithms.
